= CAE CDB Vector Data in GeoPackage Interoperability Experiment Report

Author: Bernard Leclerc
 
== Focus of CAE Experiment

We focused on Experiment #2 described on the OGC portal at this address: https://portal.opengeospatial.org/?m=projects&a=view&project_id=592

In short, we focused on the part of the experiment where each Shapefile is replaced by one GeoPackage file.

== Sample Database

We have not use the sample CDB provided by the participants because our goal was to compare the performance of our internal applications when running with a CDB produced by CAE before and after the replacement of Shapefiles with GeoPackage files.
